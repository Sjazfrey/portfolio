      <pre>“Life is either a daring adventure or nothing [at all].”
      — Helen Keller</pre></br>

      I am a life long learning and leader that enjoys the beautiful mountains of Colorado. I started my career life as
      a Physical Therapist Assistant and then got promoted to a Rehab Manager. With the world changing and my therapist
      friends wanting technology to make their testing and documentation easier and quicker, I soon realized, I could do
      that! I returned to school to learn coding to help people in a different way. I finished General Assembly's
      Software Immersion bootcamp in August of 2020.

           <strong> Memory Game​- First Project: </strong>Using GitHub, DOM, AJAX, CSS, jQuery. This app was developed using jquery animate along with the above mentioned technologies. It's a tile base game with an 8x8 grid where the user turns over 2 tiles at a time to attempt to find a match. If the 2 tiles do not match then the tiles will flip back over and the user can take another turn.  ​"https://sjazfrey.github.io/first_project"</br>
